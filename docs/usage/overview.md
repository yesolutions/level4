# Overview

There are two primary concepts: **environments** and **manifests**. In a nutshell, _environments_ deal with core resources that
can be shared between solutions and providing common defaults, while _manifests_ define each of your individual solutions.

## Environments

Environments are where your solutions live. They both define the shared portions of your cloud infrastructure and
provide the defaults and guardrails for every solution deployed in your cloud. They are the fulcrum that provides the
necessary leverage to make deploying individual solutions effortless.



## Manifests

Manifests describe all the related resources you use in each individual solution you have. There's a lot of flexibility
in how much or how little you describe with your manifests.
